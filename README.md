# Project_Library
First Project
My first of many projects that I have completed.

This project includes a library that is able to give various responses back,
<ul>looking up accounts and what they borrowed,</ul>
<ul>seeing what the top authors and most popular books available/not available,</ul>
<ul>viewing most popular genres.</ul>

With these functions found <a href="https://github.com/JoseSilvoza/Project_Library/tree/main/public/src"><p>here</p>
